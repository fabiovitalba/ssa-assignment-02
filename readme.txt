Student name: Fabio Vitalba
Lab: #2 - Components

-------Activities completed-------
Basic activity: I completed the basic activity, implementing all Country Tax Calculators and both Shipment Readers (csv, xml).
Code annotations: I also replaced the methods getFileType() and getCountry() with the annotations @FileType and @Country.
Testing: I created Unit Tests for the TaxCalculators and an Integration Test for the ShipmentFileProcessor.

-------Problems and Incomplete Activities-------
NONE

-------AI Usage Declaration-------
I only used ChatGPT when I was stuck on getting the ShipmentFileProcessorTest-class to see the CSVReader and
XMLReader implementations. However, ChatGPT did not solve the problem and I solved it by adding the dependency for
all modules in the module-info.java.

-------Additional Comments-------
